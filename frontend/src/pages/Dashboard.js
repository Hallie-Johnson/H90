            <p>
              In 2024, healthcare has continued to improve through innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI), virtual care, and other areas. AI has allowed for better workflow for workers by automating routine tasks and providing predictive analytics. AI can help reduce the time needed to complete administrative tasks, like summarizing patient visits. AI can also help predict and manage patient flow, which allows doctors and staff to be deployed in an optimized way to areas that need them. One current example of AI in healthcare is in radiography. Radiographers can enhance an image with AI-reconstruction to make better diagnoses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Virtual collaboration has become more developed to help when specialist staff is unavailable. For example, radiology operations command centers, which are cloud-based hubs, allow doctors to communicate and/or train their colleagues from anywhere. Additionally, tele-intensive programs can reduce the burden on staff by adding more support for bedside care for patients. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Healthcare technology for home use has also improved. Items like smartwatches can help promote healthier habits by setting step goals or tracking vitals. Technologies like this allow health management to fit into peopleâ€™s lives. This technology will continue to grow, and with the addition of AI, it can lead to better measures to help predict and prevent future health issues.

              This web application, H90, uses a Node.js backend, which communicates with a MongoDB database for data storage and retrieval to provide data for dynamic D3.js charts on the Summary and Reports pages. The frontend is built with React and JWT is used for secure authentication for the login page. The backend operates on port 3000, and the frontend is served via Apache on port 80, with both being hosted on the same server. The project contains ADA/WCAG accessibility principles within the HTML. The dynamic D3.js charts fetch data asynchronously from the backend via HTTP GET calls. All pages are designed as a Single Page Application (SPA) and is hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet.
